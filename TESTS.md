# Tests
*Briefly describe what you have tested here*

1). Tested to see how to use an ini file.

2).Tested on how to create a csv file when application is run.

3). Testing connection with API.

4). Tested a for loop method to select the three currencies and finding their prices.

5). testing how to extract "price" data from results obtained.

6). Testing how to convert "cryptocurrecny" and "fiat" variables from config.ini file into an array to use the array for the API loop.

7). Came up with the idea to use another link provided from the API to get the coin and fiat separately whilst in the for loop.

8). Created a script that runs the conversion to csv method.

9). Tested an If statement so that headers inside the csv file would not repeat.

10).Started coding the calculation so that a notification will be sent to genie.

11). Created a timer that executes API() method every 60 seconds.

12). Tested if both new lists are appending their current prices.

13). Tested if method calculates the proper rate of change.

14). Tested to compare rate of changes and publish a notification.

15). Optimized more the GetPrice() method instead of using 2 lists i use only one. 

16). Optimized more the ComparePrice() method by subtracting the total amount of elements with 7(prevPrice). Then i get the last element at that point in time(newPrice).

17). When priceList[] reaches 24 elements the first 12 elements are deleted.

18). Created GNS_API_test to test out the GNS API.

19). Tested the final version of the program. Only rate of change is not functioning as required.
